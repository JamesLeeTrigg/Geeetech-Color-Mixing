# Geeetech Colour Mixing
Cura Plugins for mixing colors on Geeetech A20M/A10M printers

This version is a fork of <https://github.com/dalelovelace/Geeetech-Color-Mixing>
They can be installed together

Differences between to two plugins

<b>Original</b> : Randomly mix colours (very cool tool)

<b>This version</b> : Replicate what is available on the printers (great for repeatability)
