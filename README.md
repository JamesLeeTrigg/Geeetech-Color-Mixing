# Geeetech Colour Mixing
Cura Plugins for mixing colors on Geeetech A20M/A10M printers

This version is a fork of <https://github.com/dalelovelace/Geeetech-Color-Mixing>
They can be installed together

Differences between to two plugins
original : Randomly mix colours (very cool tool)
this version : replicate what is available on the printers (great for repeatability)
